# python-alarm-clock
A Python alarm clock using datetime, winsound, and time. Users can set an alarm in HH:MM:SS AM/PM format, and the program checks the current time in a loop. When the alarm time is reached, an audio file (alarm.wav) plays repeatedly until interrupted. The program runs on Windows and handles manual interruption gracefully.
